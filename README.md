Tel
===

A simple, open VoIP client for Python.

Requirements
------------

To execute this source code, you must have:
* [Python 2.7.x](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
* [PIL] (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

Insure that Python and each module/library is 32-bit.  I haven't exactly tested with 64-bit.

Development

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is provided in the /doc/ folder.  There should probably be more documentation in that folder than there currently is.

Bugs
----

If there is a bug, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Please insure that you have each required module installed.  Tel has only been tested in 32-bit Python, and likely does __NOT__ work in 64-bit python.
